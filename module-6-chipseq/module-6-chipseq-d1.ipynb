    "We will use some common tools such as: \n",
    "* **bwa** for alignment (<a href=\"http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml\" target=\"_blank\">http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml</a>),\n",
    "* **IGV** for visualization (<a href=\"http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/home\" target=\"_blank\">http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/home</a>) \n",
    "* Most of the workshop will be done using **HOMER** (e.g., QC of the data, peak calling etc.; <a href=\"http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/\" target=\"_blank\">http://homer.ucsd.edu/homer/</a>). HOMER was created by Chris Benner at UCSD, and I love the documentation and tutorials and the threaded humor. To install HOMER follow <a href=\"https://github.com/biom262/cmm262-2020/blob/master/Module_5/Notebooks/Install_Homer.ipynb\" target=\"_blank\">these instructions</a>."
