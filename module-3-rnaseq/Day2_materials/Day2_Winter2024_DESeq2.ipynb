While it is not necessary to pre-filter low count genes before running the DESeq2 functions, there are two reasons which make pre-filtering useful: by removing rows in which there are very few reads, we reduce the memory size of the dds data object, and we increase the speed of count modeling within DESeq2. It can also improve visualizations, as features with no information for differential expression are not plotted in dispersion plots or MA-plots.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here if we wanted to do some pre-filtering to keep only rows that have a count of at least 10 for a minimal number of samples we would do the below. The count of 10 is a reasonable choice for bulk RNA-seq. A recommendation for the minimal number of samples is to specify the smallest group size, e.g. here there are 3 treated samples. If there are not discrete groups, one can use the minimal number of samples where non-zero counts would be considered interesting. One can also omit this step entirely and just rely on the independent filtering procedures available in results(), either IHW or genefilter."

    "DESeq2 can analyze any possible experimental design that can be expressed with fixed effects terms (multiple factors, designs with interactions, designs with continuous variables, splines, and so on are all possible). By adding variables to the design, one can control for additional variation in the counts. For example, if the condition samples are balanced across experimental batches, by including the batch factor to the design, one can increase the sensitivity for finding differences due to condition. We can account for fetal_sex (or any other variable) and get a clearer picture of the differences attributable to the treatment (cell_type in our case). As cell_type is the variable of interest, we put it at the end of the formula. Thus the results function will by default pull the cell_type results unless contrast or name arguments are specified.\n",

Variance stabilizing transformation which is roughly similar to putting the data on the log2 scale, while also dealing with the sampling variability of low counts. It uses the design formula to calculate the within-group variability (if blind=FALSE) or the across-all-samples variability (if blind=TRUE). It does not use the design to remove variation in the data. It therefore does not remove variation that can be associated with batch or other covariates (nor does DESeq2 have a way to specify which covariates are nuisance and which are of interest).\n",
