## What's this course about?
CMM262/BIOM262 is designed to teach experimental and analytical approaches in modern genetics and genomics, from experimental design through data analysis in each of several topic areas. Students will come away with an intuition and basic understanding of the function of many computational tools, including their design limitations. Because this course includes computational workshops in almost every class session, it is **highly recommended** that students have previous experience in at least one of the programming languages we will use (Python, Bash, or R).

> :checkered_flag: <b>Note:</b> This 4-unit course is a _core requirement_ for students in the UCSD Genetics Training Program (http://genetics.ucsd.edu/).

## Course prerequisites
Students should have at least an introductory knowledge of genetics, so classes in genetics are listed as official prerequisites for the course.

In addition, it is **absolutely crucial** that students have at least some introductory experience with a programming language, preferably R or python. During the first week of class, we will review R, python, and bash. But after the first week, we'll immediately dive into complex usage of all three. Thus, the first week should serve more as a review than a comprehensive tutorial.

Take a look at [our course material from last year](https://github.com/biom262/cmm262-2023) to gauge the level of programming experience required. If you think you might need to refresh yourself, here are some resources:
- [A book introducing R for data scientists](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
- [A crash-course book for python](https://ehmatthes.github.io/pcc_2e/regular_index/)
- [A book that explains how to use data science libraries in python](https://wesmckinney.com/book/)

## Where can I attend class?
Classes are on Tuesday and Thursday from 9:00 AM - 11:50 AM PST.
<!-- Note: we should update this screenshot once we've decided on a date for the final and midterm -->

## Will lectures be recorded?
Lecture recordings will be posted in Canvas after class (there may be a slight delay of a couple hours due to processing).

Slides for each lecture will be attached to a README.md file within each module folder.

## When are office hours?
Office hours usually take place via Zoom from DATE/TIME. The zoom link will be shared internally with the class on Canvas!

Two Mondays this quarter will be holidays. During those weeks, office hours will be held on Wednesday at 4-5pm instead. This includes:
> Wednesday: Jan 17th 4-5pm
> 
> Wednesday: Feb 20th 4-5pm

## Where can I access assignments?
You will be able to find all homework assignments for this course on the github, in the `hw` directory. Exams materials will be shared via Gradescope. You will also be able to find all of the necessary materials for each assignment on the UCSD Jupyterhub (Data Science) Platform if you're officially enrolled. The Jupyterhub can be found here: https://datahub.ucsd.edu/hub/login

## How can I submit assignments?
We'll be using Gradescope for submitting the homework assignments, as well as the midterm and final exams. If you have not been added to the course, to sign up for Gradescope, please follow the steps outlined below:

1. Navigate to the Gradescope Website at https://www.gradescope.com/
2. Select the link in the header to "Sign Up", and then select the option to sign up as a "Student"
3. Enter the following Course Entry Code: **`6GE6ND`**
4. Input your Full Name, UCSD Email, and UCSD Student ID (should be A#######);
**Note: If you are auditing the course, please enter AUDITOR as your Student ID**
5. Select "Sign up as Student" to complete the sign-up process, and then check the email you have provided for the link to set your password and log in information

### How will homework be assigned?
Homework will be assigned on Thursdays and due on the following Thursday throughout the quarter. There will not be an assignment every week. Assignments will be announced in the week they are assigned. Submission of homework will be conducted through GradeScope and will be due by 9:00 AM PST on Thursday mornings.

### When's the midterm and final?
* **Midterm Examination:**
  * Released on **2/15/23**
  * Submission via Gradescope on **2/22/23** by 9:00 AM PST
* **Final Examination:**
  * Released on **3/13/23**
  * Submission via Gradescope on **3/20/23** by 11:59 PM PST

### What's the policy on late submissions?
If for whatever reason you cannot deliver an assignment by its associated due date, you should inform the course instructor and TAs at least a day before the due date. **For each late submission 10% of the maximal number of points is deducted for every day or part of a day that an assignment is handed in late.**

> **Note:** We know that things happen!<br>
> If you're experiencing a health or family emergency, please let the course instructors and teaching assistants know and we can work something out!

### What's the policy on regrades?
We recognize that small mistakes can sometimes propagate into large points deductions on assignments. When grading, we try to award partial credit whenever possible. However, for students that submit homework assignments with large mistakes, we will allow **one homework regrade** throughout the quarter for full credit back. 

In order to qualify for a regrade, a student must score below 80% on the assignment and they must resubmit within one week of when the assignment's grades were published. 

### What's the grading breakdown?
| Percentage | Category      |
|------------|---------------|
|    55%	   | Homework      |
|    20%	   | Midterm       |
|    20%	   | Final         |
|    5%	     | Participation |

Letter grades are assigned based on the following scale:

| Grade | Lowest Percentage |
|-------|-------------------|
| A+	  | 97%               |
| A 	  | 93%               |
| A-	  | 90%               |
| B+	  | 87%               |
| B 	  | 83%               |
| B-	  | 80%               |
| C+    | 77%               |
| C     | 73%               |
| C-    | 70%               |
| D     | 60%               |
| F 	  | 0%                |

## Participation
Participation grades will be given based off of attendance, class participation, and number of weekly surveys completed.

### Class participation
This course is designed to be highly interactive, so we greatly appreciate your participation and engagement with the material and class sessions. We would like to show respect for all instructors, especially those volunteering their time to be guest lecturers, by engaging with their content.

### Surveys
There will be a feedback survey posted to Canvas on Thurs at 9:00 am each week. Please fill them out by the next Tues at 9:00 am. We really value your feedback! It helps us improve the modules each year.

We will allot students at most three passes to submit surveys late, by the end of the quarter. We will give half credit (2.5/5 points) for every additional survey (beyond the first three) that are submitted late.

To receive late credit for a survey, you must submit it by March 16, 2023 at 11:59 pm.

## What's the policy on collaboration and plagiarism?
Plagiarism will not be tolerated. Do not copy and paste answers from the internet, and make sure all answers on homework and exams are completely in your own words.

Questions may be discussed with classmates but all work must be done individually.

## What's the policy on contacting the course instructors and TAs?
Please use office hours for questions regarding the homework assignments or take-home exams. We also strongly encourage you to post your questions on Piazza rather than emailing the TAs in case there are questions that multiple students have. If you are unable to attend office hours and have a personal question, you are welcome to contact the TAs via a private post on Piazza or through email. 

> If you must email regarding a question, please do not expect a response unless it is within working hours (Monday-Friday, 8:00 AM - 8:00 PM PST), otherwise, there is no guarantee you will receive a response.
